# In
# 	root ALL = (ALL:ALL) ALL
#
# The 1st field indicates the username that the rule will apply to `root`
# The 1st "ALL" indicates that this rule applies to all hosts.
# The 2nd "ALL" indicates that the root user can run commands as all users.
# The 3rd "ALL" indicates that the root user can run commands as all groups.
# The 4th "ALL" indicates these rules apply to all commands.

# Example 1:
# In
# 	wallace host1 = (operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm
#
# User `wallace` is allowed to run /bin/ls as `operator`, and /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm as `root`.
#
# Example 2:
# In
# 	wallace ALL = (ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL, !/sbin/reboot
# User `wallace` is allowed to run any command except /sbin/reboot.

wallace ALL = (ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
